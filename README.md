# Poly+
Poly+ is a basic shader for Minecraft, realistic! Used Chocapic13 codes for better improvement, and Capttatsu codes from BSL!

# Credits
Used Choca13's code from Chocapic13, and Capttatsu's code from BSL V5.

# Questions
_**Is it Ray Traced?**_
> Currently no. But maybe in future.


_**Can it work in low end PCs?**_
> Maybe? I will test in some low end PCs.
> Other things: Has an optmized version for LGWL (PojavLauncher)

# Thanks 😁
Thanks everyone for supporting! 
Shaders are in Early Development!
